# SocialGossip
This repository contains the source code of the project carried out for the Networking exam at University of Pisa. The work was conducted by Laura Bussi, a fellow university student, and I. The entire implementation is in Java.
The project specifics required the implementation of a simple Social Network based on the client-server model. The critical point was the implementation of a TCP-based chat system and a UDP-based multicast chatroom. We also provided a simple GUI with Java Swing.
